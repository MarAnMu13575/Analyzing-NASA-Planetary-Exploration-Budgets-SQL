# Analyzing NASA Planetary Exploration Budgets in SQL

For much of the last 60 years, NASA has been at the forefront of exploring our solar system, conducting numerous planetary exploration missions. As these are expensive science projects, budgeting plays a crucial role in managing public funds effectively. We will analyze the budget data provided by The Planetary Society, which has been cleaned up for analysis.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from The Planetary Society and contains information on NASA's planetary exploration budgets. The dataset has been prepared to facilitate data analysis and insights (DataCamp dataset).

Link to the dataset: [Planetary Exploration Budget Dataset](https://www.planetary.org/space-policy/planetary-exploration-budget-dataset)

## Objectives

The main objectives of this analysis are as follows:

1. **Data Understanding**: Get an overview of the dataset and its key features.

2. **Budget Trends**: Explore the budget trends over the years to understand the allocation and utilization of funds for planetary exploration missions.

3. **Costliest Missions**: Identify the costliest planetary exploration missions undertaken by NASA.

4. **Mission Success and Budget**: Analyze the relationship between the success of missions and their allocated budgets.

5. **Budget Allocation**: Examine how the budget is allocated among different planetary exploration projects.

## SQL Queries

The analysis will be conducted using SQL queries to interact with the dataset and obtain relevant insights.

## Contribution

Contributions to this project are welcome. If you have any suggestions, improvements, or additional analyses that can be performed on the dataset, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

Through this analysis, we aim to gain valuable insights into NASA's budget allocation and utilization for planetary exploration. By understanding the trends and patterns in budgeting, we can optimize resource allocation and make informed decisions for future missions. Thank you for joining us on this journey into the cosmos! üöÄüååüõ∞Ô∏è
