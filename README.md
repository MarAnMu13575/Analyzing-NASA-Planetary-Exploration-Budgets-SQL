# Analyzing-NASA-Planetary-Exploration-Budgets-in-SQL-

For much of the last 60 years, NASA has been at the forefront of exploring our solar system. In this live training, we'll see how much money they spent to do this.

For expensive science projects, not least those funded with public money, the price of conducting research is a huge consideration, so budgeting is important.

Here, we'll use a cleaned up version of the public dataset provided by the The Planetary Society.
